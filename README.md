# The Herald ZW -  News Paper 

This project is a proof of concept of a fast loading web app bootstrapped with [Frontity](https://frontity.org/).
The theme is an edited version of Frontity's Mars Theme, if you want to create your own theme [check out this guide](https://tutorial.frontity.org/)

#### Why I Created it?

- Experiment with JAMstack tech.
- Read the news without the bloated advertisements and comments.
